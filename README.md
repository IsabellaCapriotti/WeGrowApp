# WeGrowApp
A cross-platform Xamarin Forms app aimed at helping users who are trying to gain a healthy amount of weight due to health concerns, ED recovery, or other personal reasons. 
Allows you to keep daily logs of your intake in three different methods- calorie counting, food group tracking, or a more freeform note-taking style. 
The UI is plant-themed, to stick with the message of "growing" in a healthy, nourishing way!


## Notes
This app was developed in Visual Studio 2019: Community Edition. 
The Assembly, Java, and C++ language files in this repo come from all of the project files from Visual Studio, along with the 
auto-generated code in the Android and iOS projects. 
The code I wrote for the app can mainly be found within the WeGrow folder. 

Thanks for checking out this little project!
